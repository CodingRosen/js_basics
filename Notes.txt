Git Repository Notes
Git and Github are NOT the same
    Git is the language used for version control
    Github is a hosted (online) storage of Repositories
        like Gitlab, BitBucket both use Git
CMD: git clone <url>
    Makes a local copy of git Repository typically from Github
    Note: exclude the example < >
CMD: git status
    Shows what is/is not staged for commit

CMD: git pull
    Get changes from hosted Repo (Github Repo typically)
CMD: git push
    Update hosted Repository with my local committed changes
CMD: git commit -m "this is a commite message"
    Commit will add a snapshot of my code at this point in time
        -m means message so I will know why I am saving this commit aka snapshot
        Note: -m " my commit message" is required

CMD: git add <file>
    Add a file to the Staging area that will be committed

Branches:
Git has different branches aka folders all different versions of the same original folder
CMD: git branch
    Shows available branches, * means you're current on this branch
CMD: git checkout <branch name>
    Switches to an existing branch
CMD: git checkout -b <new branch name>
    Creates a new branch and switches to it
Each breakdown:
